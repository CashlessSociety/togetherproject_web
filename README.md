### Website for the together project


## installation steps 

**Assuming you have node**

```
> git clone git@github.com:CashlessSociety/togetherproject_web.git
> cd togetherproject_web
```
(You can also use `https://github.com/CashlessSociety/togetherproject_web.git` but if you have been giving access to the repo its best to use the ssh version above))

```
> cd ~/cashless/togetherproject_web
> npm install
> npm start 
```

## Avataaars 

We are using avataaars from https://avataaars.com

There is a sketch file, which (if you download and install sketch) can be used to add/remove or update avataaar images.

Or if you wanna just tweak things you can (maybe) start with[this sketch file](https://sketch.com/s/ddf3016e-b669-4d6e-93f1-72e7f82533b7).. if you have the permissions etc
